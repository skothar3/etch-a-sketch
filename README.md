# etch-a-sketch

My version of an online etch-a-sketch tool via the Odin Project with additional features such as color grab, shading, grid dimension adjustment etc.

I made a point to build almost the entire tool with vanilla JavaScript simply because I wanted to practice adding and manipulating elements within the DOM. The index.html file is therefore very sparse. This approach is obviously not recommended and is more difficult to interpret!

Inspiration for the visual layout and additional features was taken from Github users michalosman and bscottnz.
